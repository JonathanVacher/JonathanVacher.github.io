Since 2016 I'm an associate professor of French secondary education. I'm on leave for postdoc research. 
This is the highest degree in teaching (French "agrégation").

I teached the undergraduate courses in maths listed below between 2013 and 2015. I also gave individual math oral exams to undergrad students (classes préparatoires, CPGE) in 2011/2012.

## Linear Algebra: Euclidean Spaces and Quadratic Form 
Tutorials 3 hours per week in 2014 and 2015 : [course](/pdf/algebra-course.pdf) and [exercises](/pdf/algebra-td.pdf) by Olivier Glass (French).

## Differential Calculus 
Tutorials 1:30 hours per week in 2015.

## Analysis: Continuity and Differentiability 
Tutorials 3 hours per week in 2013.


## Oral Examination
Individual test for undergraduate students, 2 hours per week in 2011/2012 (CPGE -- lycée Janson de Sailly). Here are some [exercises](/pdf/exercices-MPSI.pdf) (in French).
