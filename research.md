# Textures Synthesis
## Motion Clouds: Dynamic Stimulation for Neurosciences and Psychophysics
A python example code is available [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JonathanVacher/projects/tree/master/motion_clouds/). Many dynamic texture examples are shown [here](...). 

## Future work 
The sPDE formulation of Motion Clouds allows for real-time stimulation. However the spatial stationary covariance does not depend on time. Such an extension appears naturally and one can imagine designing stimuli parametrized by trajectories instead of constant values. Yet, this extension has some drawbacks. In particular the parameters of the solution are not equal to the input parameters but follow them with some delay. Some theoretical work must conducted to properly handle this delay. Then, it will possible to control the parameters with respect to neural responses using Bayesian prediction models (for instance, by seeking to maximize the responses).
